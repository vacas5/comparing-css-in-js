# Comparing CSS in JS options

For a NashJS meetup talk, I wanted to compare CSS in JS libraries as an alternative to importing CSS (or processed stylesheets) in React applications. Trying to check my bias against new things as much as possible and evaluate each one.

I began with the following mock that I found on the internet as my starting point:

Using Create React App as a starter, I first implemented with global CSS stylesheets (see vanilla folder). Then I created pull requests to refactor using the following methods:

- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/vacas5/comparing-css-in-js/pull/6)
- [Emotion](https://github.com/vacas5/comparing-css-in-js/pull/3)
- [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vacas5/comparing-css-in-js/pull/4)
- [styled components](https://github.com/vacas5/comparing-css-in-js/pull/5)
